    "The filter method is a technique used in feature selection, which is a process of selecting a subset of\n",

    "model or conducting an analysis. The filter method involves evaluating the importance or relevance of\n",

    "  These methods select the most relevant features during the model training phase,\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "1. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator):\n",
    "   - LASSO is a regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function,\n",
    "     encouraging the model to select a sparse set of features.\n",
    "   - It performs both feature selection and regularization by imposing a constraint on the absolute values of the regression coefficients.\n",

    "2. Elastic Net:\n",
    "   - Elastic Net is an extension of LASSO that combines both L1 (LASSO) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms.\n",
    "   - It balances the advantages of LASSO (sparse feature selection) and Ridge (handling multicollinearity) regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Decision Trees:\n",
    "   - Decision trees can be used for embedded feature selection by considering feature importance scores.\n",
    "   - Features that contribute more to the reduction in impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy) are considered more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Random Forest:\n",
    "   - Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.\n",

    "5. Gradient Boosting Machines:\n",
    "   - Gradient Boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, can be used for embedded feature selection.\n",

    "6. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Regularization:\n",
    "   - RFE is a wrapper method, but it can be embedded by combining it with regularization techniques.\n",
